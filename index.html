                        Hello! My name is Jack Stoltz, and I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech. Originally from Brooklyn, NY, I have a lifelong passion for technology and innovation that has been the guiding force behind my academic, extracurricular, and career pursuits. Growing up in a city as dynamic and fast-paced as New York shaped me in many ways, instilling in me a natural curiosity and adaptability that continue to inspire my work. I'm driven by a desire to create impactful solutions and applications, and Georgia Tech has proven to be the ideal environment to cultivate these ambitions.<br> <br><h2 style="color:black">Academic Pursuits and Interests</h2>
At Georgia Tech, I am deeply immersed in the world of computer engineering, a field that bridges hardware and software and provides the foundation for countless technologies shaping the modern world. I'm particularly fascinated by the intersection of software development and embedded systems, as well as by the potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning to redefine how we interact with technology. My courses have provided me with a strong foundation in these areas, covering everything from algorithm development and data structures to hardware design and network security.
This comprehensive education has strengthened my understanding of the technology that powers everything from smartphones to complex AI systems. I have a profound respect for the technical complexities and the innovation required to bring these systems to life. At the same time, my coursework has pushed me to develop the problem-solving skills and logical thinking required to tackle the challenges engineers face today.
<br> <br><h2 style="color:black">Extracurricular Involvement and Personal Projects</h2>
One of the things I value most about my time at Georgia Tech is the opportunity to collaborate on innovative projects with like-minded individuals. Through my involvement in several tech clubs and organizations, I've been able to explore my interests and gain hands-on experience that has proven invaluable. For instance, I am a member of [a relevant Georgia Tech organization, like the RoboJackets or the coding club], where I regularly work on challenging projects that push me to think outside the box. These projects require technical knowledge and demand teamwork, communication, and adaptability—skills that I know will be essential in any future career.
Beyond structured organizations, I frequently engage in personal projects with friends and classmates who share my enthusiasm for technology. We're constantly brainstorming new ideas, testing out different technologies, and experimenting with ways to bring our visions to life. One recent project involved developing a mobile app aimed at [describe the purpose of the app, e.g., optimizing study schedules or helping people learn to code]. Working on this project allowed me to improve my skills in mobile development, UI/UX design, and backend integration. It was immensely rewarding to see our concept evolve into a functional application, and the process taught me a great deal about project management, from planning and coding to debugging and final implementation.

These experiences have also taught me the importance of leadership and collaboration. In many of our group projects, I often find myself stepping into leadership roles, guiding discussions, setting project timelines, and ensuring everyone is aligned with our goals. I've learned that effective leadership is about being adaptable, open to others' ideas, and willing to take on responsibility while supporting the growth and success of the team. These are skills I know I will carry forward into my professional life.

<br> <br><h2 style="color:black">Professional Experience and Internships</h2>
In addition to my academic and extracurricular pursuits, I've been fortunate to gain professional experience through internships in the tech industry. Working with established companies has allowed me to see firsthand how software engineering and computer science principles are applied in real-world settings. During my internship at [Company Name], I had the opportunity to work on [describe a specific project or technology used]. It was a challenging and rewarding experience, as I was tasked with [explain tasks briefly, like optimizing an algorithm, debugging software, etc.], which required me to draw upon my technical knowledge while adapting to a fast-paced work environment.

These professional experiences have given me valuable insights into the industry and helped me understand the high standards and attention to detail that are expected in software development. Internships have also underscored the importance of collaboration and communication, as I frequently worked with teams across various departments to ensure our projects were aligned with the company's broader objectives. Seeing how individual contributions fit into larger, company-wide goals has given me a greater appreciation for teamwork and the importance of clear, effective communication.

<br> <br><h2 style="color:black">Hobbies and Personal Interests</h2>
While my academic and professional pursuits are a significant part of my life, I also have several hobbies and interests that keep me grounded and balanced. Growing up in Brooklyn fostered in me a love for exploring new places and discovering diverse cultures, which has developed into a passion for travel. I believe that traveling is one of the best ways to broaden one's perspective and learn about different ways of life. I've been fortunate to visit several countries, and each experience has left a lasting impact on me. From sampling unique foods to experiencing new languages and customs, travel has enriched my life and taught me to be open-minded and adaptable.

Aside from travel, I love spending time outdoors, especially hiking. Whether I'm trekking through the scenic trails near Atlanta or exploring parks further afield, hiking allows me to unwind, connect with nature, and recharge. I find that spending time in nature provides a sense of clarity and focus that is often hard to find in our busy, technology-driven world. Hiking also challenges me physically, and I enjoy pushing myself to tackle new trails and achieve personal goals.

Basketball is another passion of mine, and I make it a point to play regularly. It's not only a great form of exercise but also an excellent way to build camaraderie and teamwork skills. Basketball requires quick thinking, strategic decision-making, and strong communication—all skills that are valuable both on and off the court. Whether I'm playing in a competitive setting or just shooting hoops with friends, I appreciate the discipline and focus that the game demands.

Finally, I am a bit of a foodie, always excited to try new and unique dishes. From sampling local street food to experimenting with different cuisines at home, I find food to be a fascinating way to experience and understand different cultures. Each new dish I try feels like a small adventure, and I love the creativity and diversity found in the culinary world. This passion for food also extends to cooking, where I enjoy experimenting with recipes and attempting to recreate flavors I've encountered during my travels.

<br> <br><h2 style="color:black">Looking to the Future</h2>
Looking ahead, I am excited about the endless possibilities that lie within the field of computer engineering and software development. I aspire to work on projects that push the boundaries of what technology can achieve, whether through innovative applications, AI-driven solutions, or contributions to emerging fields like quantum computing. I am particularly interested in the ways technology can be leveraged to solve real-world problems, and I hope to be part of a team where creativity and innovation are encouraged and valued.
